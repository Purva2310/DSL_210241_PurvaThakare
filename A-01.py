#--------------------PROBLEM STATEMENT--------------------------
# In second year computer engineering class, group A
# studentâ€™s play cricket, group B students play badminton and group C students play football.
# Write a Python program using functions to compute following: -
# a) List of students who play both cricket and badminton
# b) List of students who play either cricket or badminton but not both
# c) Number of students who play neither cricket nor badminton
# d) Number of students who play cricket and football but not badminton.
# (Note- While realizing the group, duplicate entries should be avoided, do not use SET built-in
# functions)



# Function to remove duplicates from a list
